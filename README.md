Gymbuddy.io
===========

The website is hosted at http://gymbuddy.io.

Gymbuddy.io is a free, open, non-profit web service by gymers for gymers. The primary 
objective is to provide a quick and easy way for gymers to connect with 
other gymers in their area to either workout together, or motivate each other 
through other means. It works using sort of like a craigslist model.

The stack consists mainly of Javascript, both in the front end and back end, 
and html ofcourse. The idea is to keep it simple, no images, no css, no fluff. 
We just want to provide a really easy interface built using semantic html that 
works cross-platform and will require very little or no maintenance. Most of 
the contributors either have full time jobs or other commitments anyway, and
none of us here are waiting to make a quick buck at the cost of people trying 
to be healthy and help others to do the same.

Philosophy
----------

* The service is and always will be free, open, fair.
* Community first. All your ideas matter. This document is not set in stone, and all reasonable feedback from the community will be incorporated after some discussion.
* Every resource will be accessible in a html and json format.
* To access the api, append the url with ?format=json. This allows other services to plug and play with ours. The default format will be html.
* Completely semantic html, although some use of javascript is permitted esp for google maps integration.
* Most relevant information should be displayed before the flap, everything else under.
